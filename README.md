# UnityUnrealSteamData
A collection of data from Steam and Wikipedia about games using Unity or Unreal Engine

This repository has the code to scrape Wikipedia for Unity games and Unreal games. The code also shows how to access certain endpoints of Steam. Copyright of the data belongs to the writers and contributors of the sources (links found in the code). 

This repository also continas a csv of my first successful scrape.

UPDATE:
Unfortunately, Wikipedia has removed both the lists of the games made with Unity, as well as the games made with Unreal. The Steam API calls still work, but unfortunately the code will not run as is for the Wikipedia section.
